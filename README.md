# Does serving static files from multiple routes in Meteor implies to multiply /public installations ?

This is the question I posted yesterday on StackOverflow.

The behavior I find with this demo application is detailed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75402993/does-serving-static-files-from-multiple-routes-in-meteor-implies-to-multiply-pu/).

And the work-around I finally found...

Enjoy!
